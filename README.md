# linear_algebra
Arithmetic systems solver.

This program can be primarily used to solve arithmetic systems (the coefficients matrix must have non zero determinant, in order for the system to have only one solution). Run the program and follow the steps that are printed in terminal.
The code also contains many functions that execute linear algebra operations on matrices that are given by the user. After all the whole program was made as a practice tool for linear algebra.
Anyway, as a final note I am telling you: DO NOT USE THIS THING I MADE. The functions are very insufficient and your work can be done simple, easier and better with the functions of python library numpy and the usage of specialized software, like Matlab or Octave.
